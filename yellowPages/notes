Am able to use scrapy to create a spider and crawl through yellow pages. Need to
determine the hierarchy of tags that are needed to extract all the relevant 
info. I think the first thing to do is to grab the business names first and 
store those. The ideal way of doing this is to create YellowPageItem objects and
store those into a JSON for future use.
